## Overview
Small CLI that I used to learn about Rust, definitely a work in progress. It just gives you some bus, and hopefully soon, train times. The 
data comes from an API maintained by Atlanta's MARTA. The MARTA API is no longer avaible and has been replaced by a real-time feed
maintained by Google, so this will need to be updated.
